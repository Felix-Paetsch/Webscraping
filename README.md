# Webscraping
Project to create webscraping scripts for different websites.<br />
(Discord, DeepL, Langenscheidt, ...)

See each subfolder for more information.

Even though these scripts allow you to collect data from different websources, please make sure you get the necessary permissions to do so before using them. Additionally: Even if you are allowed to scrape from any of these sites, be aware that scraping in general can be a huge load on any infrastructure which can possibly result in DDOS. So I recommend scraping only in reasonable intervals and at times where the sites are most likely to not be frequented as much as during peak times during the day.
